# Introduction
This was my fork of the XWD Radar, made before the project even released. I was forced to delete the repository in Summer of 2024, but now that it's "open source", I guess I can do this now.

## Features
- Customizable Map Types: Toggle between light mode, dark mode, or satellite.
- Real-Time Radar & Satellite: Radar and satellite images are updated every 10 minutes, with a lot of customization, such as smoothing, animation speed, color schemes, and more.
- Weather Alerts: Weather alerts and watches are updated every minute or so, and mesoscale discussions are updated around every 15 minutes.
- Reports: View verified tornado, wind, or hail reports made in the last 2 hours, updated every minute.
